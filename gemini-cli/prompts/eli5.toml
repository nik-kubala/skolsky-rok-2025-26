{{args}}

## ELI5 Explanation Guidelines

### 1. Use Simple Language
- Avoid technical jargon completely
- Use everyday words
- Short, simple sentences
- No acronyms unless explained

### 2. Relate to Everyday Life
Use analogies from common experiences:
- Food and cooking
- Playing games
- Family and friends
- School and playground
- Toys and activities
- Animals and nature
- Sports

### 3. Tell a Story
Make it narrative and engaging:
- Use characters
- Create a scenario
- Show cause and effect
- Make it relatable

### 4. Break It Down
Explain step by step:
- What it is
- Why it exists
- How it works
- Why it matters

### 5. Use Visual Metaphors
Paint a mental picture:
- "Imagine..."
- "Think of it like..."
- "It's similar to..."
- "Picture this..."

## ELI5 Structure

### The Super Simple Explanation
One or two sentences that capture the essence:

"[Concept] is like [everyday thing]. It helps us [benefit] just like how [analogy]."

### The Story Explanation
A short story or scenario that demonstrates the concept:

```
Once upon a time, there was [character] who wanted to [goal].
But they had a problem: [problem].

So they used [concept] which works like this:
[Step 1 using simple analogy]
[Step 2 using simple analogy]
[Step 3 using simple analogy]

And that's how [character] solved their problem!
```

### The Analogy Explanation
Multiple analogies from different perspectives:

**Food Analogy:**
"Think of [concept] like [food example]. When you [action], it's like [food process]..."

**Game Analogy:**
"It's like playing [game]. The rules are [simple rules], and you win when [outcome]..."

**Building Analogy:**
"Imagine building with LEGO blocks. [Concept] is like [building process]..."

### The Visual Explanation
Simple diagrams or step-by-step pictures (ASCII art):

```
Before:
[Simple visual showing problem]

After using [concept]:
[Simple visual showing solution]
```

### Why Should You Care?
Explain the benefit in simple terms:

"This is important because [simple benefit that matters to everyone]."

### Example in Real Life
A concrete example they can relate to:

"You know how [common experience]? Well, [concept] is what makes that possible!"

## Writing Tips

1. **Test it on a real 5-year-old** (mentally): Would they understand?
2. **One concept at a time**: Don't introduce multiple ideas
3. **Be patient**: Repeat the key point in different ways
4. **Use "you" language**: Make it personal and engaging
5. **Show don't tell**: Use examples instead of definitions
6. **Keep it fun**: Use humor and relatable situations
7. **Avoid conditionals**: Don't say "if you understand X, then Y"
8. **No prerequisites**: Assume zero prior knowledge

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't use technical terms without explaining
❌ Don't assume prior knowledge
❌ Don't make it too abstract
❌ Don't use complex sentence structures
❌ Don't skip the "why it matters"
❌ Don't make it boring
❌ Don't condescend (talk down)

## What TO Do

✅ Use simple, concrete examples
✅ Relate to their world
✅ Make it fun and engaging
✅ Show practical benefits
✅ Use repetition for key points
✅ Build from known to unknown
✅ Encourage curiosity

Generate a comprehensive ELI5 explanation that a 5-year-old (or complete beginner) can understand and find interesting.
