I have received the content of the `email.toml` file. It contains a detailed prompt template for drafting professional emails, including structure, templates by type, best practices, tone guidelines, and a checklist.

What would you like me to do with this email prompt template? For example, would you like me to use it to draft an email, or save it somewhere?
